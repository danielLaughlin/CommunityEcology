# CommunityEcology
R code and data for "A Framework for Community Ecology: Species Pools, Traits, and Filters" by Paul Keddy and Daniel Laughlin

To reproduce the analyses that are discussed in chapters 5, 7 and 8 in our book, load the R script 'communityEcology.R'. This will load the 'communityEcologyData.Rdata' file and will also source functions that are included in 'traitspaceFunctions.R' and 'minEntropy.R' scripts. All required packages are listed near the top of the 'communityEcology.R' script and you will need to install these packages if your machine does not already have them installed.
