# CommunityEcology
R code and data for "Species Pools, Traits, Filters, and Assembly Rules: a Framework for Community Ecology" by Paul Keddy and Daniel Laughlin

To reproduce the analyses that are discussed in chapters 5, 7 and 8 in our book, run the script 'communityEcology.R'. This will load the 'communityEcologyData.Rdata' file and will also source functions that are included in 'traitspaceFunctions.R' and 'minimumEntropy.R' scripts.
