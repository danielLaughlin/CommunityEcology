# CommunityEcology
R code and data for "Species Pools, Traits, Filters, and Assembly Rules: a Framework for Community Ecology" by Paul Keddy and Daniel Laughlin

To reproduce the analyses that are discussed in chapters 5, 7 and 8 in our book, load the R script 'communityEcology.R'. This will load the 'communityEcologyData.Rdata' file and will also source functions that are included in 'traitspaceFunctions.R' and 'minEntropy.R' scripts. All required packages are listed near the top of the 'communityEcology.R' script.
